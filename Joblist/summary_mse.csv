Apeel Sciences creates agricultural solutions inspired by and derived from Nature for growers to protect their crops and increase the shelf life of harvested fresh produce. We are committed to being a technological and environmental trailblazer at the interface between the agricultural, materials science, chemistry, biotechnology, and engineering industries to eliminate food waste and reduce reliance on pesticides. Our mission is to enable widespread, positive impacts through the development of high-performance pre- and post-harvest products and processes that conserve our precious natural resources and safeguard the Earth’s delicate ecological balance.

Salary: depending on qualifications
<br>
<br>
In the past two decades, hiring faculty en masse into multiple departments / colleges, or “cluster” hiring, has emerged as a practice to successfully bring on board a critical mass of interdisciplinary faculty. Cluster hiring has also been used to address other needs such as fostering interdisciplinary collaborations, launching new initiatives, broadening engagement with the community, and enhancing inclusivity. Our cluster consists of three (3) faculty members formed to support interdisciplinary scholarship under the general umbrella of “Materials Science and Engineering”. It is anticipated that these faculty will develop new areas of inquiry showing promise of future scholarly activity that places CSUN in a strategic position of strength. Cluster faculty will be expected to engage in cross-departmental and cross-college interdisciplinary scholarship.
<br>
<br>
Qualifications:
<br>
California State University, Northridge is seeking to hire three (3) full-time tenure track appointees at the rank of Assistant Professor.

194,X PRIZE Foundation,"<span class=""summary"" id=""job_summary"">ABOUT THE NRG COSIA CARBON XPRIZE
<br><br>
The NRG COSIA Carbon XPRIZE is a $20 million global competition to incentivize breakthroughs in the conversion of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) into valuable products. The winning team will convert the most CO 2 into products with the highest net value. The competition is now in the “semi-final” stage, during which 27 teams from six countries will demonstrate pilot-scale systems that convert CO 2 into products.
<br><br>
The Carbon XPRIZE will prove to the world that energy innovation can enable solutions to climate change. By demonstrating breakthrough technologies that turn CO2 emissions into valuable products, the Carbon XPRIZE will catalyze the development of markets for CO 2 mitigation technologies, and inspire other industries, governments, and educational institutions to take concrete positive action to combat climate change. In success, the competition will help shift the public sentiment to be more optimistic about climate change.
<br><br>
The XPRIZE Foundation is seeking an experienced, creative, and skilled engineer, technologist, scientist, or technical manager to support and drive technical and operational aspects of the NRG COSIA Carbon XPRIZE.
<br><br>
The Engineering Operations Manager will support the project in all areas relating to the day-to-day scientific and engineering operations of the competition. This person will assume primary responsibility for managing and supporting workflows of key external contractors, building templates and tools to evaluate team performance and competition scores, and supporting the external judging panel in their deliberations and evaluation of team performance. The Engineering Operations Manager will also support the Domain Lead for Energy and Prize Manager in managing day to day competition operations, execution of the field tests and technology validation in the competition semi-finals and finals, working with external partners to oversee construction of test facilities in the competition finals, and managing updates and publication of the competition Rules and Regulations.
<br><br>
Experience designing and/or managing large technical programs that involve testing and evaluation in either a laboratory environment and under real-world conditions will be a significant asset.
<br><br>
Ideally, this person will have a strong background in the science and technology of energy systems, carbon management technologies, chemical or materials engineering, materials and manufacturing, clean energy, and/or related hardware development. This person does not need to be an expert in CO 2 conversion. However, the ideal candidate should be comfortable acquiring knowledge relevant to the wide array of technologies and processes reflective of the competing teams. The Engineering and Operations Manager will be expected over time to develop subject matter expertise in all technical and science components of the Prize. S/he may be asked to represent the prize and XPRIZE Foundation at external events (e.g. technical conferences, panels, etc.).
<br><br>
GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AT XPRIZE
<br><br>
XPRIZE is a cross-matrixed organization. This means that most staff members are shared across multiple projects at any given time, or move across projects as they evolve. While the Engineering Operations Manager will have a primary responsibility to the NRG COSIA Carbon XPRIZE, it is anticipated that in future there may be opportunities to contribute to the operations of other prize competitions, design and launch future XPRIZE competitions, and/or help drive XPRIZE impact programs. The ideal candidate will combine technical expertise and knowhow with creativity, people skills, and an ability and desire to learn new things and take on new projects.

This position will also work with scientific and operations support staff involved in advancing scientific instrumentation capabilities. LCLS is the worldâs first hard x-ray free electron laser (FEL) with unprecedented capabilities in photon energy range, peak power, and pulse lengths. There are seven independent instruments currently in operation, which are specifically designed to utilize the exceptional beam characteristics of the LCLS to probe the structure and dynamics of matter at atomic size and timescales. The evolution of science and experimental techniques on these instruments, along with upgrades in the x-ray FEL source and optical lasers (LCLS-II), require regular improvements to the supporting software and hardware platforms. The MEC instrument is used to study extreme states of matter using high-frequency X-rays to detect changes induced by high power optical laser pulses. The AMO instrument is used to perform fundamental studies of light-matter interactions in the extreme x-ray intensity of the LCLS FEL beam, time-resolved photoionization, x-ray diffraction of nanocrystals and single shot imaging of non-reproducible objects. The science performed at the SXR beamline covers wide-spread fields such as catalysis, magnetism, correlated materials, laboratory astrophysics and biological structure. See https://portal.slac.stanford.edu/sites/lcls_public for more on LCLS and the unique capabilities of our instrument facilities.

297,Apeel Sciences,"<span class=""summary"" id=""job_summary"">Company Background
<br><br>
In the United States, over a third of all the food we grow is lost to spoilage and wasted before we can eat it. In the developing world, more than half of all produce is lost to spoilage before it can be consumed. Apeel Sciences creates agricultural solutions inspired by and derived from Nature for growers to protect their crops and increase the shelf life of harvested fresh produce. We are committed to being a technological and environmental trailblazer at the interface between the agricultural, materials science, chemistry, biotechnology, and engineering industries to eliminate food waste and reduce reliance on pesticides. Our mission is to enable widespread, positive impacts through the development of high-performance pre- and post-harvest products and processes that conserve our precious natural resources and safeguard the Earth’s delicate ecological balance.
<br><br>
Company Culture
<br><br>
Apeel is comprised of highly talented, deeply passionate, and strongly tight-knit team members who are excited by the opportunity to challenge the status quo, are obsessed with solving problems, and truly seek to positively change how we feed the world.
