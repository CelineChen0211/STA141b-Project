More About Atara Bio
<br><br>
We are a four-year-old approximately 100-person clinical stage publicly traded ( NASDAQ exchange symbol ATRA ) biopharmaceutical company focused on meaningful therapies for patients with severe and life-threatening diseases that have been underserved by scientific innovation. We are co-located by design in Westlake Village, CA (northwest LA) and South San Francisco, CA, with a process development lab in the Denver, CO area at the Fitzsimons Innovation Center and offices in New York City.
<br><b>We have two groups of product candidates:</b> (a) allogeneic, or third-party derived, antigen-specific T-cells, and (b) molecularly targeted biologics.
<br>Our initial T-cell product candidates are CTLs that target viral- or cancer-specific antigens and are designed to harness the body’s immune system to counteract specific viral infections and cancers. Our most advanced T-cell product candidate, EBV-CTL, is entering into Phase 3 trials for Epstein-Barr virus, or EBV-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders, or EBV-PTLD
<br>Our molecularly targeted product candidate is STM 434. Atara Bio commenced a Phase 1 clinical study of STM 434 for ovarian cancer and other solid tumors in 2014.
<br>We have agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the designs of two Phase 3 trials for ATA 129 intended to support approval in the treatment of rituximab-refractory EBV-Associated Post Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder (EBV-PTLD) after hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) or solid organ transplant (SOT). These two Phase 3 trials will support potential approvals in two separate indications.
<br>We have also announced in parallel to scientific advice from the European Medicines Agency's (EMA's) Scientific Advice Working Group and several national Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Agencies in the EU, the plan to submit in 2018 an application for Conditional Marketing Authorization Approval (Conditional MAA) of ATA 129 in the treatment of patients with rituximab refractory EBV-PTLD following hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). The Conditional MAA will be based on clinical data from Phase 1 and 2 trials conducted at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) and supported by available data from the Company's Phase 3 studies in rituximab refractory EBV-PTLD after HCT and solid organ transplantation (SOT), which will be ongoing at the time of filing.
<br>The FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation for EBV-CTL in the treatment of rituximab-refractory EBV-PTLD after HCT and FDA has granted orphan drug designation for EBV-CTL for the treatment of patients with EBV-PTLD after HCT or SOT.
<br>The EMA has granted orphan drug designation for EBV-CTL for the treatment of patients with EBV-PTLD. EBV-CTL was accepted into the EMA’s Adaptive Licensing Program and in June 2016, the EMA classified our EBV-CTL product candidate as an Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product, or ATMP EMA granted access to its newly established Priorities Medicines, or PRIME, regulatory initiative for EBV-CTL in the treatment of patients with rituximab refractory EBV-PTLD after HCT. Access to the PRIME initiative is granted by the EMA to support the development and accelerate the review of new therapies to treat patients with unmet medical need. The criteria for the PRIME initiative require early clinical evidence that the therapy offers a therapeutic advantage over existing treatments or benefits patients with limited treatment options.

<b>About the Col l ege:</b> Situated on Monterey Bay in the county of Santa Cruz, California, Cabrillo College is one of the most highly regarded community colleges in the state for its success in the area of transfer and career education, and currently serves over 12,500 students each semester. Cabrillo College transfers many of its students to three nearby universities - the University of California at Santa Cruz, San Jose State University in the heart of Silicon Valley, and California State University at Monterey Bay. Cabrillo's career education is closely connected to the nearby Silicon Valley business environment as well as that of the greater San Francisco Bay Area. Cabrillo focuses on student-centered learning and has a tradition of collegial governance.
<br><br>
Faculty at Cabrillo College have a long history of shared governance and participation in all levels of decision-making at the college. Cabrillo provides an excellent opportunity to learn, collaborate, create, and make a difference in the lives of its students and community.

<b>About the Department:</b> The Chemistry program parallels the offerings of four-year colleges and also supports health occupation programs. The Chemistry Department at Cabrillo College is committed to quality teaching and enjoys a cohesive, mutually supportive atmosphere. The students that return after achieving their educational and vocational goals tell us that their chemistry instruction at Cabrillo provided excellent preparation. Cabrillo's transfer students often do better at four-year colleges than students native to the four-year institutions. Maintaining high academic standards is critical to the continued success of our students and is, therefore, important to each and every faculty member. Our continuing goal is to always remain student-centered without sacrificing academic rigor.

362,X PRIZE Foundation,"<span class=""summary"" id=""job_summary"">ABOUT THE NRG COSIA CARBON XPRIZE
<br><br>
The NRG COSIA Carbon XPRIZE is a $20 million global competition to incentivize breakthroughs in the conversion of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) into valuable products. The winning team will convert the most CO 2 into products with the highest net value. The competition is now in the “semi-final” stage, during which 27 teams from six countries will demonstrate pilot-scale systems that convert CO 2 into products.
<br><br>
The Carbon XPRIZE will prove to the world that energy innovation can enable solutions to climate change. By demonstrating breakthrough technologies that turn CO2 emissions into valuable products, the Carbon XPRIZE will catalyze the development of markets for CO 2 mitigation technologies, and inspire other industries, governments, and educational institutions to take concrete positive action to combat climate change. In success, the competition will help shift the public sentiment to be more optimistic about climate change.
<br><br>
The XPRIZE Foundation is seeking an experienced, creative, and skilled engineer, technologist, scientist, or technical manager to support and drive technical and operational aspects of the NRG COSIA Carbon XPRIZE.
<br><br>
The Engineering Operations Manager will support the project in all areas relating to the day-to-day scientific and engineering operations of the competition. This person will assume primary responsibility for managing and supporting workflows of key external contractors, building templates and tools to evaluate team performance and competition scores, and supporting the external judging panel in their deliberations and evaluation of team performance. The Engineering Operations Manager will also support the Domain Lead for Energy and Prize Manager in managing day to day competition operations, execution of the field tests and technology validation in the competition semi-finals and finals, working with external partners to oversee construction of test facilities in the competition finals, and managing updates and publication of the competition Rules and Regulations.
<br><br>
Experience designing and/or managing large technical programs that involve testing and evaluation in either a laboratory environment and under real-world conditions will be a significant asset.
<br><br>
Ideally, this person will have a strong background in the science and technology of energy systems, carbon management technologies, chemical or materials engineering, materials and manufacturing, clean energy, and/or related hardware development. This person does not need to be an expert in CO 2 conversion. However, the ideal candidate should be comfortable acquiring knowledge relevant to the wide array of technologies and processes reflective of the competing teams. The Engineering and Operations Manager will be expected over time to develop subject matter expertise in all technical and science components of the Prize. S/he may be asked to represent the prize and XPRIZE Foundation at external events (e.g. technical conferences, panels, etc.).
<br><br>
GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AT XPRIZE
<br><br>
XPRIZE is a cross-matrixed organization. This means that most staff members are shared across multiple projects at any given time, or move across projects as they evolve. While the Engineering Operations Manager will have a primary responsibility to the NRG COSIA Carbon XPRIZE, it is anticipated that in future there may be opportunities to contribute to the operations of other prize competitions, design and launch future XPRIZE competitions, and/or help drive XPRIZE impact programs. The ideal candidate will combine technical expertise and knowhow with creativity, people skills, and an ability and desire to learn new things and take on new projects.

More About Atara Bio
<br><br>
We are a four-year-old approximately 100-person clinical stage publicly traded ( NASDAQ exchange symbol ATRA ) biopharmaceutical company focused on meaningful therapies for patients with severe and life-threatening diseases that have been underserved by scientific innovation. We are co-located by design in Westlake Village, CA (northwest LA) and South San Francisco, CA, with a process development lab in the Denver, CO area at the Fitzsimons Innovation Center and offices in New York City.
<br><b>We have two groups of product candidates:</b> (a) allogeneic, or third-party derived, antigen-specific T-cells, and (b) molecularly targeted biologics.
<br>Our initial T-cell product candidates are CTLs that target viral- or cancer-specific antigens and are designed to harness the body’s immune system to counteract specific viral infections and cancers. Our most advanced T-cell product candidate, EBV-CTL, is entering into Phase 3 trials for Epstein-Barr virus, or EBV-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders, or EBV-PTLD
<br>Our molecularly targeted product candidate is STM 434. Atara Bio commenced a Phase 1 clinical study of STM 434 for ovarian cancer and other solid tumors in 2014.
<br>We have agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the designs of two Phase 3 trials for ATA 129 intended to support approval in the treatment of rituximab-refractory EBV-Associated Post Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder (EBV-PTLD) after hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) or solid organ transplant (SOT). These two Phase 3 trials will support potential approvals in two separate indications.
<br>We have also announced in parallel to scientific advice from the European Medicines Agency's (EMA's) Scientific Advice Working Group and several national Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Agencies in the EU, the plan to submit in 2018 an application for Conditional Marketing Authorization Approval (Conditional MAA) of ATA 129 in the treatment of patients with rituximab refractory EBV-PTLD following hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). The Conditional MAA will be based on clinical data from Phase 1 and 2 trials conducted at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) and supported by available data from the Company's Phase 3 studies in rituximab refractory EBV-PTLD after HCT and solid organ transplantation (SOT), which will be ongoing at the time of filing.
<br>The FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation for EBV-CTL in the treatment of rituximab-refractory EBV-PTLD after HCT and FDA has granted orphan drug designation for EBV-CTL for the treatment of patients with EBV-PTLD after HCT or SOT.
<br>The EMA has granted orphan drug designation for EBV-CTL for the treatment of patients with EBV-PTLD. EBV-CTL was accepted into the EMA’s Adaptive Licensing Program and in June 2016, the EMA classified our EBV-CTL product candidate as an Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product, or ATMP EMA granted access to its newly established Priorities Medicines, or PRIME, regulatory initiative for EBV-CTL in the treatment of patients with rituximab refractory EBV-PTLD after HCT. Access to the PRIME initiative is granted by the EMA to support the development and accelerate the review of new therapies to treat patients with unmet medical need. The criteria for the PRIME initiative require early clinical evidence that the therapy offers a therapeutic advantage over existing treatments or benefits patients with limited treatment options.

More About Atara Bio
<br><br>
We are a four-year-old approximately 100-person clinical stage publicly traded ( NASDAQ exchange symbol ATRA ) biopharmaceutical company focused on meaningful therapies for patients with severe and life-threatening diseases that have been underserved by scientific innovation. We are co-located by design in Westlake Village, CA (northwest LA) and South San Francisco, CA, with a process development lab in the Denver, CO area at the Fitzsimons Innovation Center and offices in New York City.
<br><b>We have two groups of product candidates:</b> (a) allogeneic, or third-party derived, antigen-specific T-cells, and (b) molecularly targeted biologics.
<br>Our initial T-cell product candidates are CTLs that target viral- or cancer-specific antigens and are designed to harness the body’s immune system to counteract specific viral infections and cancers. Our most advanced T-cell product candidate, EBV-CTL, is entering into Phase 3 trials for Epstein-Barr virus, or EBV-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders, or EBV-PTLD
<br>Our molecularly targeted product candidate is STM 434. Atara Bio commenced a Phase 1 clinical study of STM 434 for ovarian cancer and other solid tumors in 2014.
<br>We have agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the designs of two Phase 3 trials for ATA 129 intended to support approval in the treatment of rituximab-refractory EBV-Associated Post Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder (EBV-PTLD) after hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) or solid organ transplant (SOT). These two Phase 3 trials will support potential approvals in two separate indications.
<br>We have also announced in parallel to scientific advice from the European Medicines Agency's (EMA's) Scientific Advice Working Group and several national Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Agencies in the EU, the plan to submit in 2018 an application for Conditional Marketing Authorization Approval (Conditional MAA) of ATA 129 in the treatment of patients with rituximab refractory EBV-PTLD following hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). The Conditional MAA will be based on clinical data from Phase 1 and 2 trials conducted at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) and supported by available data from the Company's Phase 3 studies in rituximab refractory EBV-PTLD after HCT and solid organ transplantation (SOT), which will be ongoing at the time of filing.
<br>The FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation for EBV-CTL in the treatment of rituximab-refractory EBV-PTLD after HCT and FDA has granted orphan drug designation for EBV-CTL for the treatment of patients with EBV-PTLD after HCT or SOT.
<br>The EMA has granted orphan drug designation for EBV-CTL for the treatment of patients with EBV-PTLD. EBV-CTL was accepted into the EMA’s Adaptive Licensing Program and in June 2016, the EMA classified our EBV-CTL product candidate as an Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product, or ATMP EMA granted access to its newly established Priorities Medicines, or PRIME, regulatory initiative for EBV-CTL in the treatment of patients with rituximab refractory EBV-PTLD after HCT. Access to the PRIME initiative is granted by the EMA to support the development and accelerate the review of new therapies to treat patients with unmet medical need. The criteria for the PRIME initiative require early clinical evidence that the therapy offers a therapeutic advantage over existing treatments or benefits patients with limited treatment options.

Biocompatible lipids have attracted attention as potential carriers for small molecule drug compounds. In particular, solid lipids have emerged as promising drug delivery vehicles. Solid lipids can be formulated as conventional suspensions as well as nanoparticles, colloidal drug carrier systems similar to microemulsions where the liquid lipid or liposomal vehicle has been replaced by a more stable lipid that is a solid at ambient temperature. Solid lipids are also biocompatible and biodegradable with many having GRAS status (Generally Regarded As Safe).
