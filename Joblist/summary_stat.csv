Our customers, around the world and across industries, have some of the biggest and most interesting data problems to solve. Cloudera helps customers store and manage their data with open source software, and our team's mission is to teach them to uncover the surprising and valuable insights in data. Are you the type of data scientist who enjoys talking shop at length? digging into practical problems with messy real-world data? building open source tools that improve the experience of data scientists building models on huge amounts of data? <br>
<br>
<b>Our Team.
</b>The Data Science team at Cloudera is a small, expert team based in the US and UK. We provide our expertise in methods and tools (like R, Python, and Apache Spark) internally and to our customers. We're engineers and statisticians, the practical types, who regularly build and contribute to open source tools. We also collaborate with our architects and customers' analysts to prototype new analytics projects and ""teach the organization to fish"". All of us talk about data science a lot, and regularly evangelize the practice of data science through writing and speaking. We provide strategy and advice for Cloudera and our customers. <br>
<br>
<b>Being a Data Scientist at Cloudera
</b>As a Cloudera Data Scientist, you would spend about half time with our customers, helping them to solve their analytics problems in short projects in conjunction with our architects. Depending on your areas of expertise you'd be called on to sometimes just provide advice on a problem. Occasionally, this entails some travel.
<br>
<br>
Otherwise, in collaboration with the rest of the team, you'll become an expert in open source tools for analytics in the Hadoop ecosystem. You'll help us create blog posts and white papers, and deliver talks about important issues and techniques in data science as well. <br>
<br>
<b>And You Are ...
</b>Data science is a broad and quickly changing field. You will be a good fit for our team if you are up for both learning new tools and techniques and sharing your knowledge with others. A data scientist who will be successful on our team will enjoy, more than anything, teaching the world about data science. An ideal candidate will be comfortable acting independently, enjoy talking to customers about their challenges, and rapidly building prototypes.
<br>
<br>
A data scientists who will be successful in this job is likely to have 5+ years of industry experience, and a BS / MS (or equivalent) in Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics or a similar field. A working knowledge of Linux and a strong working knowledge of linear algebra, statistics and essential machine learning techniques will be important. Working knowledge of Apache Hadoop components (Spark, HDFS, YARN, etc.) is not required but will be helpful.
<br>
<br>
For us, specialized expertise in an analytics technique like deep learning, NLP, or anomaly detection, would be a plus, as is expertise in an industry (healthcare, telecom, e-tailing, etc.)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>",Data Scientist

The best optimization R&amp;D; role- period.
<br>
<br>
The context: Amazon ships millions of unique shipments through its Fulfillment Network. Product is procured from tens of thousands of vendors, third party sellers into the multiple fulfillment centers in the Amazon network. Merchandize from these vendors needs to be transported from vendor locations to these fulfillment centers and between fulfillment centers as we balance our inventory across our network. Amazon has the largest selection – merchandise is associated with varying dimensions, restrictions and shipping costs – this selection is key to Amazon’s virtuous cycle for growth. Post purchase by customers, we are responsible for transportation of shipments from fulfillment centers to customers; this involves moving shipments from our fulfillment centers to sortation centers and delivery depots. This results in a gigantic graph, with the nodes being vendors, Amazon.com fulfillment centers, sort centers, delivery depots and end customers. The arcs in this graph represent the time of transportation and cost of transportation. Each node has a specific capacity, and so does each arc, and there are time constraints on when a product needs to ship out of a node and when it needs to come into a different node. And Amazon needs to do all of this while incurring the least cost, this presents a great opportunity to leverage large scale network optimization models to drive decision making processes.
<br>

We are looking for motivated individuals with strong numerical optimization and analysis skills to join our team focusing on transportation network modeling and design. You will be responsible for building tools to determine the means to efficiently transport shipments from vendors to our fulfillment centers, as well as from fulfillment centers to our customers. In particular, you will focus on building models that will be leveraged to drive the optimization of the transportation infrastructure, transportation contract negotiation, increase speed of delivery and evaluate opportunities to decrease cost through new initiatives.

To utilize these information systems to analyze biological information and to identify genes of therapeutic interest.
<br>
<br>
Project 1:
<br>
Intern will be responsible for conducting one or more pooled CRISPR-based competitive screening experiments to clarify molecular processes driving Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal transition. They will work in partnership with a Genentech scientist to cultivate, infect and maintain existing cell line models for the duration of the screen, to validate experimental treatment and model properties, to collect the material and generate sequencing libraries, and then analyze the screen results. These responsibilities may be extended to include a computational project related to CRISPR screening methods and infrastructure depending on the proficiency of the candidate.
<br>
<br>
Project 2:
<br>
RNA splicing is a highly regulated process. Deregulation of transcript isoforms plays an important role in human and its evasion from targeted therapies. A better understanding of such cancer-specific transcript isoform usage may allow us to discover new cancer targets and biomarkers as well as resistance mechanisms. However, the interpretation of isoform quantifications is non-trivial and especially differential expression analyses of isoform usage may require approaches that differ from gene level analyses. As a result, isoform expression has largely remained unexplored in many biological contexts.
<br>
<br>
The successful candidate will explore the landscape of currently available tools for differential isoform expression analysis and apply them to biologically relevant questions. The candidate will be responsible for the evaluation of multiple differential isoform expression methods under various scenarios that simulate real RNA-seq experiments with the goal to identify the best performing approach. Leveraging the extensive in-house collection of RNA-seq data he/she will work closely with scientists outside of the department to identify experiments that will benefit from isoform-level differential expression analyses. Potential questions of interest will include (but are not limited to) explaining drug sensitivity using differential isoform expression, identifying cancer-specific isoform expression associated with mutations in the splicing machinery and detecting isoform expression differences in subtypes of cancer.
<br>
<br>
Project 3:
<br>
The intern will use data from clinical trials to assess genetic determinants of response to cancer immunotherapy. The goal is to identify genetic loci that might impact efficiency or safety of immune checkpoint blockade.

<b>Opportunity Details:</b><br>
<b>Overview:</b><br>
The major objective of this job is work to discover, report upon, and correct data quality issues throughout DEERS production databases. The overarching goal is to continually improve the general state of data quality AND the organization’s visibility into its current state of data quality.
<br><br>
As the first order of business after starting, you will work with Data Quality Lead, senior EandB/DMDC staff, and other EandB Data Quality Team analysts to rapidly learn the business rules, business processes, and technical architecture of DEERS and DMDC, as well as the processes employed by the EandB Data Quality Team in their daily work. Broadly understanding the business and technical details of the organization is absolutely critical for a data quality analyst to have a meaningful impact. Due to the complexity of DEERS and the nature of the team’s work, this learning is a continual process.
<br><br>

A successful candidate must be an excellent multi-tasker and must prioritize work based on the real world impact of each issue at hand.
<br><br>
<b>Responsibilities:</b><br>
Work on a fast-paced team responsible for monitoring and maintaining Data Quality within very large Oracle production databases. Find, investigate, and map out strategies to correct data quality issues that impact any of numerous DEERS business areas, particularly military healthcare benefits &amp; eligibility and duplicate identities resolution. Work includes both responding to urgent data quality issues as they arise as well as proactive analysis to discover and research previously unknown problem areas. Use SQL and PL/SQL to investigate data quality issues and continue to expand the team’s suite of recurring and ad-hoc error reports to assess the state of data quality in DEERS and monitor these reports for anomalies pointing to new issues to examine. Work closely with other data quality team analysts, management, project managers, business analysts, developers, quality assurance and DBAs to determine root causes for data quality issues and devise remediation plans that both prevent future occurrences and restore data that has already been affected. Position demands active, continuous collaboration and learning about the business rules underlying the many lines of business, as well as the variety of data stores, data sources, applications and tiers that make up the DEERS architecture. Candidate must be willing to constantly seek out this knowledge from other senior staff in the course of day to day work. Candidate must be a self-driven individual who can work on many concurrent projects and deliver results on each, whether working independently or collaborating with other members of the team. Role has potential for advancement for high-achieving individuals.

CPI works to redirect finance from high- to low-carbon activities and helps decision makers use their resources wisely. We provide much-needed information on climate finance flows, apply in-depth analysis to guide decision makers on their efforts, and support innovation in finance to address investors’ needs and lower costs.

<br><br>
Under the supervision and guidance of the Executive Director of Climate Finance and the Director of CPI’s San Francisco office, the Analyst undertakes robust and careful analysis, drawing on methodologies from micro- and macroeconomics, public policy, regulatory economics, finance, behavioral science, risk management, statistics, law, engineering, and other academic and commercial disciplines.

The Team
<br>Just about anyone seeking published literature to answer research questions can type terms into a database and then hope to make sense of the information retrieved. But when done without the right knowledge, skills, and experience, such an exercise risks answers that are biased, confusing, incomplete, or wholly incorrect. This helps explain what makes Meta Research different. We offer broad clinical knowledge and expertise in finding and assessing complex information. This effort is further enhanced by our breadth of experience in quantitative evaluation of the evidence, including meta-analyses. This means our clients and Evidera colleagues can rely on us to discover, synthesize, and contextualize the data that really matter and thereby provide them with insights they could not have obtained by themselves. Through these efforts, our clients are provided with an approach that can be customised to fit needs that range from internal landscape overviews to network meta-analyses to support reimbursement submissions to health technology assessment bodies. Here are just some of the things we help our clients and colleagues do:
<br><br>
Understand new indications in context of specific product strategy.
<br>Estimate clinical comparisons of products versus competitors using quantitative methods.
<br>Derive model inputs.
<br>Populate dossiers.
<br>Inform planning for primary research, such as choice of patient-reported outcome instruments and comparators in clinical trial design.

<br>Populate regulatory documents to support queries related to SLR and NMA methods

In addition to such team-wide interests and priorities, you will be the independent principal investigator/consultant of projects and oversee all aspects of project delivery, including delegating project-management tasks to junior staff. This role will also involve scientific responsibility for project completion, strategic consultation, and for use of best methods to address research needs. Specifically, this will include design and implementation of selected studies; conceptualization of advanced study designs; and development of study protocols.
<br><br>
<b>You will:</b><br>
Lead interactions with clients in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries.
<br>Review and finalize project deliverables and ensure study findings are valid and reliable.
<br>Have final responsibility for project budgets, deliverables and timelines; and identify scope expansion and need for amendments
<br>Participate in business development, including input into proposal review, kick off meetings and bid defence meetings by reviewing key challenges and suggesting solutions.
<br>Support sales through methodological excellence
<br>Review, track and own annual sales target
<br>Be accountable for growth in your area of responsibility.

At the core of LiveRamp’s products is a massive graph that connects the different identifiers for each person, their online devices, and the identifiers that 100s of different marketing platforms use to recognize them. As a LiveRamp Data Scientist you’ll analyze the complex connections in this half a trillion node graph that contains PBs of data from over a 1000 different sources. To work with this massive dataset, you’ll learn cutting edge big data analysis tools (e.g., Redshift ( https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/ ) and Pregel ( https://kowshik.github.io/JPregel/pregel_paper.pdf )). Using the results of your investigations, you’ll further develop our conceptual framework for understanding LiveRamp’s identity graph, including new terminology, metrics, mathematical models, visualizations, and reports. Further, you’ll apply this conceptual framework to create new data refinement strategies that filter out suspect connections to further enhance the quality of LiveRamp’s identity graph.
<br><br>

<li>Of paramount importance is understanding identity accuracy (i.e., correctness) and reach (i.e., completeness, how many people can we match?).</li>
<li>Apply this conceptual framework in the development of data refinement strategies that enhance the accuracy of our identity graph.</li>
<li>Explore and quantify the reach and accuracy implications for incorporating new sources of identity data into the graph.</li>
<li>Quantify the “holes” in our identity graph. I.e., what types of consumers are we missing identity data for?</li>
</ul>

<br>------------------------
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>2+ years Data Science experience or a graduate degree (PhD or thesis-based Masters) in a quantitative field.</li>
<li>Strong grasp of statistics and data mining techniques.</li>
<li>Solid experience with Python, R or other statistical toolsets (we use Python).</li>

<li>Desire to work in San Francisco. We will relocate you if necessary.</li>
</ul>
What We'll Give in Return
<br>-------------------------
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Stock</li>
<li>Awesome co-workers</li>
<li>Unlimited paid time off</li>
<li>A dog friendly office</li>
