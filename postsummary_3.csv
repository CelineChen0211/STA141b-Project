The Providence Institute for Human Caring is leading a transformation of health services to emphasize whole person care.

Dr. Ira Byock, a national expert on palliative care, leads the Institute for Human Caring. Under his guidance, the Institute is working to encourage patients to talk with their doctors and families about what kind of care they want through the end of life. This is the first step toward whole person care.
<br><br>
Most Americans want to spend their final days at home, surrounded by loved ones. Yet about 70 percent of people spend their last days in hospitals or nursing homes. This can deprive patients and their families of the comfort they need at a difficult and emotional time. The Institute for Human Caring believes whole person care can help change this. The result will be better care and support for everyone who is sick, and their families.

• You believe that the best ideas should win, and you’re not afraid of advocating for or supporting a less popular idea on its merits. You are also not afraid to admit when you are wrong.
<br>
• You get excited about tackling big, complicated, and often ambiguous problems and have autonomy in decision making.
<br>
• You understand that human behavior is complex and changing behaviors is a lot harder than building features and technology.
<br>
• You love products - trying new things, asking yourself, why did they build it that way, questioning what would happen if you’re comfortable communicating and negotiating across the organization, you get your points across without being a jerk, and people like working with you even if they might disagree with you, you’ve got good UX instincts you won’t need to do your own design, but you’ll need to work effectively with your designer and researcher peers.
<br>
• You enjoy thinking analytically, you won’t be expected to write SQL queries, but you’ll need to work effectively with your data analyst peers.
<br>
<br>

• Manage a growing team of product managers (4-6 people)
<br>
• Suggest and lead changes in our organizational structure, execution, and systems.

<br>
• Analyze data to optimize performance and focus on the product areas with the highest potential to drive usage.
<br>
• Constantly learning, asking questions, being humble, and supporting your team members.
<br>
• Using the product, we’re building every day, and constantly questioning how we can make it more useful for our users and customers.
<br>
This is how we do it:
<br>
• Build iteratively, ship quickly, test our assumptions, and learn -- it keeps us humble.
<br>
• Rotate project areas and across product goals it keeps us from being silo’ed. This means your team will work on every aspect of the product.
<br>
• Bring in all the right resources (data analysts, research, design, copy, engineering) from the beginning, it keeps us respectful of a diversity of perspectives.
<br>
<br>

650,Microsoft,"<span class=""summary"" id=""job_summary"">Are you a problem-solver looking to work on a product that makes people’s lives better?
<br>
The everyday employees who use Yammer tell us that they feel smarter, more appreciated by their coworkers, and more connected to the jobs where they spend 8+ hours a day, every day. That’s what motivates us to come to work, support each other, and keep making our product better.
<br>
<br>
Is this the right job for you?
<br>
- You get excited about tackling big, complicated, and often ambiguous problems and have autonomy in decision making
<br>
- You understand that human behavior is complex and changing behaviors is a lot harder than building features and technology
<br>
- You love products - trying new things, asking yourself “why did they build it that way?”, questioning ‘what would happen if…?’
<br>
- You’re comfortable communicating and negotiating with cross-functional teams - you get your points across without being a jerk, and people like working with you even if they might disagree with you
<br>
- You’ve got good UX instincts -- you won’t need to do your own design, but you’ll need to work effectively with your designer and researcher peers
<br>
- You enjoy thinking analytically -- you won’t be expected to write SQL queries, but you’ll need to work effectively with your data analyst peers
<br>
<br>
This is what you’ll be doing:
<br>
- Collaborate with other product managers, designers, researchers, data analysts, and engineering teams to determine product strategy and prioritize the features that will bring the most value to our customers
<br>
- Manage the product development process from conception through design, build, release, A/B testing, analysis, and iteration
<br>
- Analyze data to optimize performance and focus on the product areas with the highest potential to drive usage
<br>
- Constantly learning, asking questions, being humble, and supporting your team members
<br>
- Using the product we’re building every day, and constantly questioning how we can make it more useful for our customers
<br>
<br>
This is how we do it:
<br>
- A/B test everything (including our own instincts and assumptions), build iteratively, and ship quickly -- it keeps us humble.
<br>
- Rotate project areas, from web to mobile and across product goals -- it keeps us from being silo’ed.
<br>
- Bring in all the right resources (data analysts, research, design, copy, engineering) from the beginning -- it keeps us respectful of a diversity of perspectives.
<br>
<br>
Required Qualifications:
<br>
You have designed and shipped products that lots of people use and love. Depending on the size and type of teams/companies you've worked at in the past, that could translate to anywhere from 2-5+ years' experience.
<br>
<br>
Yammer and Microsoft: Yammer is now an integral part of Office 365, has grown significantly over the past years and is used by millions of users. Yammer helps power other Microsoft experiences including Delve, Office 365 video and SharePoint. Yammer helped accelerate the company-wide adoption of product usage as a key success metric. With all this, Yammer is well setup to be a major engine of growth for Microsoft and Office 365.
